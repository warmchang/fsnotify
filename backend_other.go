// Watcher watches a set of paths, delivering events on a channel.
//
// A watcher should not be copied (e.g. pass it by pointer, rather than by
// value).
//
// # Linux notes
//
// When a file is removed a Remove event won't be emitted until all file
// descriptors are closed, and deletes will always emit a Chmod. For example:
//
//	fp := os.Open("file")
//	os.Remove("file")        // Triggers Chmod
//	fp.Close()               // Triggers Remove
//
// This is the event that inotify sends, so not much can be changed about this.
//
// The fs.inotify.max_user_watches sysctl variable specifies the upper limit
// for the number of watches per user, and fs.inotify.max_user_instances
// specifies the maximum number of inotify instances per user. Every Watcher you
// create is an "instance", and every path you add is a "watch".
//
// These are also exposed in /proc as /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches and
// /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances
//
// To increase them you can use sysctl or write the value to the /proc file:
//
//	# Default values on Linux 5.18
//	sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=124983
//	sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_instances=128
//
// To make the changes persist on reboot edit /etc/sysctl.conf or
// /usr/lib/sysctl.d/50-default.conf (details differ per Linux distro; check
// your distro's documentation):
//
//	fs.inotify.max_user_watches=124983
//	fs.inotify.max_user_instances=128
//
// Reaching the limit will result in a "no space left on device" or "too many open
// files" error.
//
// # kqueue notes (macOS, BSD)
//
// kqueue requires opening a file descriptor for every file that's being watched;
// so if you're watching a directory with five files then that's six file
// descriptors. You will run in to your system's "max open files" limit faster on
// these platforms.
//
// The sysctl variables kern.maxfiles and kern.maxfilesperproc can be used to
// control the maximum number of open files, as well as /etc/login.conf on BSD
// systems.
type Watcher struct {
	// Events sends the filesystem change events.
	//
	// fsnotify can send the following events; a "path" here can refer to a
	// file, directory, symbolic link, or special file like a FIFO.
	//
	//   fsnotify.Create    A new path was created; this may be followed by one
	//                      or more Write events if data also gets written to a
	//                      file.
	//
	//   fsnotify.Remove    A path was removed.
	//
	//   fsnotify.Rename    A path was renamed. A rename is always sent with the
	//                      old path as Event.Name, and a Create event will be
	//                      sent with the new name. Renames are only sent for
	//                      paths that are currently watched; e.g. moving an
	//                      unmonitored file into a monitored directory will
	//                      show up as just a Create. Similarly, renaming a file
	//                      to outside a monitored directory will show up as
	//                      only a Rename.
	//
	//   fsnotify.Write     A file or named pipe was written to. A Truncate will
	//                      also trigger a Write. A single "write action"
	//                      initiated by the user may show up as one or multiple
	//                      writes, depending on when the system syncs things to
	//                      disk. For example when compiling a large Go program
	//                      you may get hundreds of Write events, so you
	//                      probably want to wait until you've stopped receiving
	//                      them (see the dedup example in cmd/fsnotify).
	//
	//   fsnotify.Chmod     Attributes were changed. On Linux this is also sent
	//                      when a file is removed (or more accurately, when a
	//                      link to an inode is removed). On kqueue it's sent
	//                      and on kqueue when a file is truncated. On Windows
	//                      it's never sent.
	Events chan Event

	// Errors sends any errors.
	//
	// [ErrEventOverflow] is used to indicate there are too many events:
	//
	//  - inotify: there are too many queued events (fs.inotify.max_queued_events sysctl)
	//  - windows: The buffer size is too small; [WithBufferSize] can be used to increase it.
	//  - kqueue, fen: not used.

// # Watching directories
//

// after the watcher is started. Subdirectories are not watched (i.e. it's
// non-recursive).
//
// # Watching files
//
// Watching individual files (rather than directories) is generally not
// recommended as many tools update files atomically. Instead of "just" writing
// to the file a temporary file will be written to first, and if successful the
// temporary file is moved to to destination removing the original, or some
// variant thereof. The watcher on the original file is now lost, as it no
// longer exists.
//
// Instead, watch the parent directory and use Event.Name to filter out files
// you're not interested in. There is an example of this in [cmd/fsnotify/file.go].

// AddWith is like [Add], but has the possibility to add options. When using
// Add() the defaults described below are used.

//     other platforms. The default is 64K (65536 bytes).

// Remove stops monitoring the path for changes.
//
// Directories are always removed non-recursively. For example, if you added
// /tmp/dir and /tmp/dir/subdir then you will need to remove both.
//
// Removing a path that has not yet been added returns [ErrNonExistentWatch].
